    When a user in your app or website poses a question related to the health topic, this triggers the next step.

</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="api" title="API Request">
    Make a GET request to the HealthByte API with the user’s question. This is how you interface with our system to retrieve information.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-square" title="Receive Response">
    After processing the question, HealthByte will make a POST request back to your app or website. We will deliver a concise, accurate answer tailored to the user’s query.
